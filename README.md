6502-Snake-Game
===============

This a WIP snake game written in 6502 assembly. It is designed for the fictional 6502 machine located at http://6502asm.com
or at http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/

It is maybe 75% done at this point. It's functionally a game, but pretty clunky. Reversing direction kills you.
